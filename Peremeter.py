#Activity #2 Write a Python progress that will use funtion called calculate_perimeter
#The perimeter of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula : perimeter = 2 *

def calculate_perimeter(length + width)
    perimeter = 2 * (legth + width)
    return calculate_perimeter

length = int(input("length of the rectangle"))
width = int(input("width of the rectangle"))

x = calculate_perimter (length, width)

print ("The perimeter of a rectangle is ", x)
